- Hold fast to dreams
- For if dreams die, [^fn1]:
- Life is a broken-winged bird
- That cannot fly.
- Hold fast to dreams
- For when dreams go, [^fn2]:
- Life is a barren field
- Frozen with snow,

## Footnotes 


[^fn1]:  This line speaks to the dreams that humans' have, but ultimately we have to understand that dreams can fade away, and if we don't act on making our dreams come true, they can leave us forever. 

[^fn2]: It is realistically panned out what can happen if we let our dreams slip away. They vanish in the air, or freeze with the snow.
